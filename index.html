                <p> Creating a list of the best places in a country is always bound to raise some debate when you
                    are
                    making the list in a specific order.
                    Being in the tourism industry for several years and visiting every corner of the country many
                    times,
                    this is what i think is the best place to visit in Bangladesh.
                    Let me now in the comments if you agree or disagree with me, and have any suggestion for
                    improvement of

                Bisnakandi is located in the Rustampur union of Goainghat Upazila of Sylhet.
                Sylhet’s Goainghat Upazila is filled with mountains, fountains, and greenery. The Upazila has the
                border
                with India. The beauty of the places fills the attractions of the tourist. The rocky river, forest,
                tea
                orchard in the hills overwhelm the mind! Tourists come to see the beauty of Sylhet’s diversity. At
                the
                festival like Eid, these tourist centers are crowded.

                As like Jaflong, Bisnakandi is a place where the river is filled with the stone. It makes the
                surrounding
                enchanting. However, due to the uncontrolled stone lifting, the beauty of Jaflong is on the verge of
                destruction today, but the Bisnakandi retains its youth.
                Many of the steps of the Khasia Hills on the Bangladesh-India border have come from one side to the
                other,
                and the hills have the highest springs of Meghalaya in India. The main attraction of the Bisnakandi
                to the
                tourists is the transparent water stream that flows over the rocks and the whirlwind of white clouds
                over
                the mountains. At first, you will feel like a stone bed, and the calmness that you get in the clear
                water
                will bring you the peace of mind again and again. It is as though the mountains, rivers, fountains,
                and
                rocks have laid the natural bedding in Bisnakandi.

                    standing. Among the three cities of the time period: Boro nagar, Khas Nagar and Panam Nagar;
                    Panam Nagar
                    was the most attractive one.This is a beautiful place to visit. The old building facades are
                    spectacular
                    and seem so different to modern day Bangladesh. Nature is creeping in and taking over some of
                    the houses
                    but it adds to the magical appearance.
